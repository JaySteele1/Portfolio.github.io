                <p id="tab">Junior/Entry level Web and Software enthusiast here! I started of on my adventure into the developer world with HTML5 in February of 2018. With in a month I was onto CSS3 building a couple static tables to showcase those skills. Shortly after that that I
                    was learning Javascript. Learning a scripting language has been equally challenging and fun for me. I am a hard worker who strives to do the best at everything I do and learn from pesky mistakes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Automotive Technician Mike Shaw Subaru - Thorton, CO February 2019 to Present</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I only listed my current employer just to show I am currently employed.  I do not feel those jobs are relevant for Web and Software development employment. I can provide that working
            experience if desired. I have over 16 years automotive experience. I have also been working since my first summer job with a landscaping company when I was 14.</p>
        <p>Currently I am Subaru, ASE and GM certified. I have developed skills in the automotive industry over the years such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Team work: In order to fix customer concerns I need to work with the service advisor to get accurate information from the customer about their concern. I also have to communicate with the customers in-person sometimes or take test drives with
                them.
            </li>
            <li>leadership: This skill is something that comes with time. I helps to have the teamwork skill skill to be leader. Helping other employees when they are stuck on a problem or simply to get everyone working on the same page comes from years of
                experience on any industry.</li>
            <li>Problem solving: This skill is important. Being presented with a problem and being able to work through it, whether its a customer concern or just a problem in the work place, is vital.</li>


        </ul>
        <p id="tab">In my 15 plus years in automotive I see the industry moving in a direction where software will play a large roll in how our vehicles operate and communicate with each other and the world. I feel there will be a great need
            for programmers in the future not only the automotive industry but other industries globally.</p>

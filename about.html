                My name is Justin Steele. I was born and raised in Sylvania Ohio, a suburban community outside the city of Toledo. I grew up playing organized sports: Baseball, basketball, football and a couple years of soccer. I loved sports. Team sports taught me valuable
                lessons like team work, listening, leading and how to set goals and develope the skills necessary to achieve these goals which has transferred over into my adult life and career. In highschool I wrestled and played two years of football.
                I also joined the competition cheer-leading team my senior year which was the same time as wrestling season so balance the two was a challenge.</p>
            <p id="tab">I have always been a fan of snowboarding. In high school I started getting into snowboarding heavily and going out to ride at the closest "mountains" I could find which for me where up in Michigan at Alpine Valley or Mt Brighton. Both are
                pretty small but they build parks and pipes pretty well. My first experience on a "real" mountain was out here in Colorado at Loveland. We rode a half day before heading up to Steamboat springs for a weekend trip with friends. Steamboat
                quickly became my favorite place to ride with their champaign powder and sick tree runs such as the christmas tree bowl. That was it for me. I came back out here to look for a job. I was invited to live my friend and his wife who had already
                been living here for a couple of years. I moved here at the end of March 2006 and have enjoyed every minute of it. I have an 11 year old son who started ski lessons when he was 5 and has switched back and forth between boards and ski's.</p>

                <p id="tab" class="col-md-4">My first goal after learning to develope webpages and software is to obviously land a job. Using the skills I have developed I feel I can contribute much in this industry. From using frame works like Bootstrap and being able to build custom
                    pages I will be able to build upon these skills while working with a company. Web development is not going away and will be important for the future of businesses globally.</p>
                <p id="tab" class="col-md-4">Secondly I'd like to be a fullstack developer building both the front-end and back-end of web pages and apps. I feel it is important, at least for my career, that I am able to perform these duties. I know it will not happen over night
                    and thats where the learning comes in. I love to learn knew things, it keeps me challenged. I've always felt that acquiring knowledge should be our driving force in life in order to better ourselves as a species rather than monetary
                    wealth.

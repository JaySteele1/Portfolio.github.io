    <p> Hello John Smith,</p>
    <p id="tab"> This is Justin Steele with <strong>Schomp BMW</strong>. Thank you for expressing interest in purchasing or leasing a new <strong>BMW MODEL</strong>. We appreciate you giving us the opportunity to earn your business.</p>
    <p id="tab">A perk of driving a new <strong>BMW</strong> is <strong>BMW Ultimate Care:</strong> a <em>complimentary manufacturer scheduled maintenance program</em> for the first 3 years or 36K miles, whichever comes first. As a token of our gratitude, we’re pleased
        to offer you a <em>complimentary maintenance upgrade</em> to <strong>BMW Ultimate Care+</strong> with the purchase or lease of any <strong>New BMW. BMW Ultimate Care+</strong> is a $600 value that reduces your <em>out-of-pocket</em> maintenance
        expenses during your ownership. It extends coverage to specific items that need replacement due to normal wear and tear and that aren’t covered by the original New Vehicle Limited Warranty. <strong>BMW Ultimate Care+</strong> covers items such
        as brake pads, brake rotors, clutch, wiper blade inserts, and any applicable adjustments required due to normal operating conditions. There are a number of manufacturer programs available: Finance/Purchase credits up to $3,000, Lease Credits up
        to $2,000 and other manufacturer incentives that <strong>WILL APPLY.</strong></p>
    <p id="tab">*These offers expire on August 31, 2018. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about qualifications. I can be reached at 720-555-5555 or by simply replying to this email. Thanks again. I look forward to visiting with you and helping you
        find your next vehicle.</p>
    <p id="tab">At <strong>Schomp BMW</strong>, we provide our clients a unique and revolutionary <strong>One Price. One Person. One Hour.</strong>® sales experience. We work diligently to find the most cost effective way for you to lease or purchase your BMW by
        exploring all current manufacturer programs and incentives that are available.</p><br><br>
    <p>Best Regards,</p>
